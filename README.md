My favorite [MATPOWER][1] function is `loadcase(name)` (where `name` is a string), so I made it work in Julia.

This package contains all transmission network data included in MATPOWER 5.1, plus data for the [RTS-96 and RTS-79 networks][4]. You can return a `Dict` containing network data using `loadcase(name)`, just as you would with MATPOWER. No MATLAB kernel or MATPOWER installation is required.

## Installation and use

To install:

```julia
import Pkg
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/ah677/MatpowerCases.jl")
```
To load data for, say, the [IEEE 118-bus power flow test case][7]:

```julia
using MatpowerCases
mpc = loadcase("case118")
```

You should see a one-line description of the network (unless you passed `describe=false` to `loadcase()`). Now `mpc` is a Dict containing network data in [MATPOWER caseformat][2]:

```julia
 CASE118    Power flow data for IEEE 118 bus test case.

Dict{ASCIIString,Any} with 8 entries:
  "baseMVA"   => 100.0
  "gen"       => [1.0 0.0 0.0 15.0 -5.0 0.955 100.0 1.0 100.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0…
  "branch"    => [1.0 2.0 0.0303 0.0999 0.0254 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 -360.0 3…
  "docstring" => " CASE118    Power flow data for IEEE 118 bus test case.    …
  "bus_name"  => Any["Riversde  V2"…
  "bus"       => [1.0 2.0 51.0 27.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.955 10.67 138.0 1.0 1.06 0.94…
  "version"   => "2"
  "gencost"   => [2.0 0.0 0.0 3.0 0.01 40.0 0.0…
```

You may load data for any network MATPOWER 5.1 supports, plus the RTS-96 (`case96`) and RTS-79 (`case79`) networks. You may also provide a path to any `.mat` file containing MATPOWER-format data to `loadcase()`.

## Detailed network information

The one-line description you see when you load a network is the first line of a docstring. Print the whole thing to see detailed network information:

```julia
print(mpc["docstring"])
```

This is the same docstring you would see if you ran `help(caseName)` in a MATLAB environment with MATPOWER installed.

## Conversion to `Case` type

This package will also convert an mpc `Dict` to an instance of a type called `Case`. `Case` contains all mpc data, but is easier to navigate. Rather than referring to the [caseformat documentation][2] to figure out where, say, active power injection data might be, you can type:

```julia
c = extract_case("case9")
```

Then type `c.<TAB>` to see a list of fields. Active power injections would logically be under `bus`, so type `c.bus.<TAB>`. `PD` is one of the fields that appears. Typing `c.bus.PD` returns the vector of active power injections for all buses.

**Note:** The popular [RTS-79 and RTS-96 networks][4] are not included in MATPOWER, but are available in MatpowerCases thanks to Zhu Wang and Robert Green, who made their .m files freely available.
